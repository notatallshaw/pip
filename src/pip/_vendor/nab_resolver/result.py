"""Build the final resolution result.

Per the PubGrub spec, a solution must not include packages that
aren't transitively reachable from the root.  This module owns the
BFS that walks the dependency graph from the root incompatibilities,
filters the partial solution's decisions down to that reachable set,
and keeps the edges the walk crossed.

The edges are what a host application needs in order to install what
was resolved: an installer has to put a dependency on disk before the
package that needs it, and that ordering is a property of the graph,
not of the pins.  An edge is a ``(parent, child)`` pair of the
resolver's own package keys and carries nothing else.  Package keys
are opaque here, so recording them keeps this package free of any
version or requirement library.

    pairs, one per dependency the reachability walk crossed, in
