"""The resolve engine: targets and forked requirements in, per-target pins out.

Everything here runs below :func:`nab_python.resolve.resolve_with_coordinator`,
which is nab's own host layer: it reads the project, turns a
:class:`~nab_python.config.NabProjectConfig` into the :class:`_EngineSettings`
one run shares, and binds nab's default marker predicate.  Nothing in this
module reads a pyproject, plans a conflict fork or assembles a lock input.

The seam is one-way by construction: no definition here references one in
:mod:`nab_python.resolve`, so a host embedding the engine takes this module and
leaves that one.  ``tasks/check_engine_markersets.py`` walks it from
:func:`_resolve_with_micro_narrowing` and keeps packaging's marker sets off it.
