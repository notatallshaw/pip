    Fetches version lists and .metadata through a

    submits listing fetches to a background asyncio loop, so transitive deps
    are fetched concurrently with resolution; a host that supplies its own
    port decides for itself what a request costs.

    ``target`` is the environment the resolve is for: its markers gate
    every dependency, its Python filters candidates by Requires-Python,
    and its wheel tags filter candidates by PEP 425 compatibility, so a
    version whose only wheels the target cannot install is a version the
    resolver never sees.  Left unset, markers evaluate against the host
    and neither filter runs, since nothing has said which machine the
    resolve targets.

    ``constraints`` are the user's version bounds, keyed as the resolver
    keys packages, so an extras proxy carries its base's bound under its
    own ``name[extra]`` key.  The provider reads them when deciding
    whether a missing root extra is worth reporting.

    ``preferences`` are versions another resolve already decided, tried
    first when they are usable here.  A multi-target resolve passes the
    pins of an already-resolved target, which aligns the matrix on one
    version where every target can take it.  A package the strategy wants
    lowest for ignores the preference and takes its own floor.

    ``listing_filter_cache`` shares the platform-independent half of the
    listing filter with the other targets of the same resolve; see
    :class:`ListingFilterCache`.

    ``yank_policy`` is how a host that supplies its own candidates says
    which of them are PEP 592 yanked and when a yanked one is still
    selectable; see :class:`YankPolicy`.  Unset, nothing is yanked, which

        clauses and force-backtrack signal are drained, and the per-package abort
        markers, force-backtrack budget, and no-versions reasons are restored to
        their pre-probe values.  A failed-resolve attribution probe therefore
        cannot alter a later decision.

        The one exception is ``package``'s own no-versions reason.  When the

        no-match the constraint-narrowed pass recorded.  The reason map only
        labels a ``NO_VERSIONS`` clause, so keeping it cannot alter a decision.

        The probe also suppresses both look-ahead shortcuts, which could
        otherwise report a version the decided blocker rejects: it hides the
        abort markers (so neither a fresh abort nor a recorded skip fires) and
        sets ``_probing_satisfiable`` to skip the abort and to keep checking
        decisions past ``_BROAD_LA_REJECT_CAP``.

        The un-narrowed range spans versions the constraint clipped away, so
        look-ahead can reach one whose metadata raises a hard error the narrowed
        resolve never touched (a failed integrity check, or a tie-ranked-wheel
        divergence).  The probe catches those and returns ``False`` rather than
        aborting; the crash still fires when the version is pinned for real.  The

        ``blockers`` carries the look-ahead rejection causes when
        every candidate that fell in ``version_range`` was rejected:
        either because of an already-decided package, a positive-range
        constraint, a root-requirement disagreement, or because the
        candidate's metadata could not be read under the current
        build policy.  When supplied, the recorded reason names those
        causes so the user does not see a bare "no version matches
        the requirement", which would suggest the package is
        missing from the index when in fact it is the resolver's
        transitive constraints (or a too-strict build policy) that
        excluded every candidate.

        ``version_range`` is passed only when no surviving version fell
        inside it.  A version the listing filter dropped that does fall
        inside it is the release the requirement asked for, so the reason
        names the filter rather than reporting no match.

        ``all_versions`` is post-filter, so an empty one means either the
        index served no files or every file it served was dropped by the
        wheel-tag filter, requires-python, dist-policy, or the upload-time
        cutoff.  The stored listing tells absence from incompatibility
        apart, except that it is also empty for an index skipped offline
        and for a page of formats nab does not read (``.zip`` sdists,
        ``.exe`` installers).  Both are marked when stored so the reason
        names them instead of absence.
        The wheel-tag case (a Windows-only package on a Linux target) is
        named only when the base pass dropped nothing, or when the file
        it dropped was an sdist: there the reason names both the rejected
        tags and the filtered sdist, because the sdist is what the user
        can bring back.  A base-filtered wheel alongside a tag-rejected
        wheel on another version reports the base-filter reason alone.

        A look-ahead rejection emits a clause that removes the rejected
        versions from the range, so the resolver asks again over a range
        nothing falls in.  That second ask has no blockers of its own, so
        its no-match reason must not overwrite the one naming the blocker.

        The recorded value is a :class:`~nab_python.diagnostics.NoVersionsReason`,
        not a sentence.  ``str()`` on it is nab's wording; a host that has to
        produce its own reads the kind and the counts behind it.  The counts
        are copied in, because the provider's tallies keep rising after the
