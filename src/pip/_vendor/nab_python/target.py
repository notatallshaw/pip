"""The environments one resolve runs against.

A :class:`ResolveTarget` is a complete PEP 508 marker environment plus
the wheel tags that environment accepts.  A resolve runs against a list
of them: the host interpreter alone, the one target
``[tool.nab.environment]`` declares, or one per (python, platform,
implementation) point a :class:`Matrix` expands to.  They all feed the
same provider, so the resolver has a single notion of "the environment
we are resolving for".

A declared target synthesizes its markers from the platform and
implementation it names, never from the interpreter running nab: a
matrix that models linux/3.11 must answer the same way on a macOS host.
A host target takes them from ``packaging.markers.default_environment``
untouched, and says so through :attr:`ResolveTarget.host_faithful`,
which is what tells a caller whether running a build backend here would
report metadata for the target or for someone else.
