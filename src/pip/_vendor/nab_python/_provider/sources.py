"""Local-source, VCS-source, and archive-source materialisation.

A ``LocalSource`` becomes the only candidate for a package: PyPI is
not consulted.  A ``VcsSource`` clones the repo and an ``ArchiveSource``
downloads and hash-verifies a ``.tar.gz`` and extracts it; both reuse the
``LocalSource`` extraction path.  Each produces a single synthetic
``SdistFile`` whose version is read from ``[project].version``.
