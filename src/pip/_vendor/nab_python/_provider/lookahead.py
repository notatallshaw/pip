"""Decision-aware look-ahead for :class:`nab_python.provider.Provider`.

Owns ``_look_ahead_ok`` and the pending-block tables that record
"this candidate is incompatible with this decision/positive range"
rejections.  Each rejection becomes a grouped binary
incompatibility (``{candidate range, blocker range}``) when
``flush_pending_blocks`` runs at the end of ``choose_version``.
Version-derived terms are widened onto the listing's gaps, which
leaves the selectable versions they name unchanged.  The blocker term
widens further when every rejection in the group recorded a dependency
range: each fired because the blocker sat outside that range, so every
blocker version outside their union repeats the same rejections.
Groups queued without ranges, such as the extras block path, keep the
narrower term.
