    Sorting: newest version first. When the effective ``dist-policy``
    is PREFER_WHEEL or SDIST_INSTALL, wheels sort before sdists at
    the same version so the metadata picker hits the cheapest source
    first.  ``normalized`` is the canonical package name used to look
    up the per-package / per-index ``uploaded-prior-to`` and
    ``dist-policy`` overrides; the serving index is read from the
    coordinator.

    This is the single funnel into ``versions_cache``, so what it drops
    is gone from candidate selection, metadata sourcing, every prefetch
    path, look-ahead, the emitted wheel list, and ``nab download``.

    A wheel whose PEP 425 tags the target does not accept is dropped
    (:func:`excluded_by_wheel_tags`), and a version left with no
    compatible wheel and no sdist is dropped with it: the target cannot
    install it, so the resolver must not pin it.  An sdist keeps a
    version alive at every :class:`~nab_python.provider.BuildPolicy`,
    which is what stops the filter over-refusing a pure-source package;
    the tag check is a wheel's check, as it is in pip.  Look-ahead
    rejects the version later if the sdist's metadata cannot be read
    under the policy in force.

    The dist-policy and upload-time cutoff are version-scoped: a
    per-package override applies only to candidate versions inside its
    requirement's range, so each version's policy is evaluated against
    its own :class:`Version`.

    Under :attr:`~nab_python.provider.DistPolicy.SDIST_INSTALL` a
    version keeps its wheels in ``versions_cache`` as a cheap metadata
    source only when it also publishes an sdist; a version whose only
    surviving artifact is a wheel has no source to install, so it is
    dropped and never becomes a candidate.  The kept wheels are dropped
    later, at lock construction time, so only the sdist is pinned.

    The filter runs in two passes.  :func:`base_distributions` applies
    everything that has no platform axis (dist policy, Requires-Python,
    upload cutoff, sort order, equal-version canonicalization), and is
    memoised per (package, Python) across the targets of one resolve
    when the provider carries a
    :class:`~nab_python.provider.ListingFilterCache`.  The wheel-tag
    pass then runs per target on top of that shared list, so a
    linux-only wheel still stays off the Windows target.
