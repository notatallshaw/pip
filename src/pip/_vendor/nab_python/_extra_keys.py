"""Key shapes for extras: the ``name[extra]`` proxy the resolver decides under.

An extra is resolved as its own package, keyed ``name[extra]``, so the
key spelling is shared by the config loader, the provider, and the lock
writer.  It lives here, below all three, because the spelling is a
declaration rather than provider behaviour.
