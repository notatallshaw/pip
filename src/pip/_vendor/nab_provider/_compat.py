"""Runtime fallback for :func:`typing.override`, so ``typing_extensions`` is not needed.

``override`` runs at class-body time, so unlike the annotation-only helpers it
cannot hide under ``TYPE_CHECKING``.  Looking it up by name rather than by
interpreter version keeps this free of a version-gated branch.  Before 3.12 the
fallback is the identity and so does not set ``__override__``, which nothing
here reads.
