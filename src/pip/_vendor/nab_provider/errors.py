"""The exception types that cross module boundaries inside nab.

An exception is a declaration: the module that raises it and the module that
catches it both need the class, and neither can own it without the other
importing it.  Keeping them here means the config loader and the provider can
raise each other's errors without importing each other, the build subtree can
catch a provider error without importing the provider, and the resolving side
can name a fetch failure without importing an HTTP client.

:class:`ConfigError` lives here rather than in :mod:`nab_project.config`
for the same reason it used to live in :mod:`nab_project.config_sources`:
it is the base of every config-parse error, including
``SourceConfigError`` in the lowest config layer.  Both modules re-export
it under their own names.
