"""Predict which wheel a target environment would install.

Resolution needs the install-time wheel selection answer without a
live interpreter, so a declared target's tag set is computed from
:class:`PlatformSpec` and the implementation name directly, never from
the interpreter running nab. CPython tags come from
``packaging.tags.cpython_tags``; PyPy tags are emitted directly
(interpreter ``ppXY``, abi ``pypyXY_pp73``). Both add
interpreter-agnostic tags from ``packaging.tags.compatible_tags``.
Platform tags use ``mac_platforms`` for macOS and expand the declared
libc family's tags on Linux, in the order ``sys_tags`` uses, so the
declared path and the host path rank the same wheel first. A wheel
matches the target iff its parsed tags share a member with the target's
accepted tag set.

:class:`TagSet` is that accepted set, in install-preference order. The
host builds one from ``packaging.tags.sys_tags``; a target Python on
the host machine keeps the host's platform axis and moves only the
interpreter and abi, which is what pip's ``--python-version`` does.
