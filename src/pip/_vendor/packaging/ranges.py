        Compares the bounds, the ``===`` admit/reject literals, the
        arbitrary-string flag, the configured pre-release policy, and the
        opt-in region, not just the version set. Keying on the region makes
        equality a congruence (equal ranges stay equal under further operations),
        so equal implies same :meth:`contains` and :meth:`filter`, but not the
        converse: an empty range keeps the flag it was built with, so two empty
        ranges need not be equal.

        Different specifiers for the same range fold to one canonical form:

        >>> SpecifierSet(">1.0a1").to_range() == SpecifierSet(">=1.0a2.dev0").to_range()
        True

        The opt-in region is part of equality, so ``<=1.0`` (no pre-releases) and
        ``<1.0.post0.dev0`` (autodetects a ``.dev`` opt-in) cover the same
        versions yet compare unequal:

        >>> le, lt = SpecifierSet("<=1.0"), SpecifierSet("<1.0.post0.dev0")
        >>> le.to_range() == lt.to_range()
        False

        >>> r = SpecifierSet(">=1.0,<2.0").to_range()
        >>> r == SpecifierSet(">=1.0,<2.0").to_range()
        True
