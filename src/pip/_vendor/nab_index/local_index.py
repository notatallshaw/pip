"""Local file:// index support for nab-index.

Two flavours, both keyed off a ``file://`` URL pointing at a directory:

* PEP 503 directory: ``<root>/<package>/index.html`` HTML listings,
  same anchor-tag shape that pip and uv recognise. Synthesised
  :class:`~nab_index.client.WheelFile` /
  :class:`~nab_index.client.SdistFile` records mirror what an HTTPS
  Simple API returns.
* Flat wheelhouse: a directory containing ``.whl`` and ``.tar.gz``
  files at the top level (pip's ``--find-links ./wheels`` shape).
  On-disk filenames are parsed for ``(name, version)`` and every
  distribution for a package is returned by ``get_files``.  ``.zip``
  sdists are ignored, matching the remote-index behaviour.

Reads run synchronously off the filesystem; the filesystem is the
cache. The async surface is a thin shim over the sync helpers so the
multi-index router can treat local and remote indexes uniformly.
