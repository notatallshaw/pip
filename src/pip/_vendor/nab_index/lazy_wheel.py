"""HTTP range-request reader for a remote wheel's core metadata.

Recovers a wheel's ``METADATA`` by ranged reads of the remote ZIP when the
index publishes no PEP 658 sidecar. The reader drives an
:class:`~nab_index.transport.AsyncHttpTransport`, learns each host's range
capability once per run through a shared :class:`RangeCapabilityMemo`, and
navigates the ZIP with the standard library's :class:`zipfile.ZipFile` over a
sparse buffer so no EOCD scan, deflate, or CRC logic is hand-rolled.

Two kinds of exception travel outward: a
:class:`~nab_index.client.MalformedSimpleResponseError` for METADATA bytes
that are not valid UTF-8, and the transport's error when the wheel URL itself
cannot be served (a 404 on the file, a failing plain GET).  A server that
merely refuses the Range mechanism is stepped down instead, from a suffix
range to absolute ranges to a plain full-body GET.  Every other failure to
obtain metadata returns a result whose ``text`` is ``None``.
