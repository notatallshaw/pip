Add experimental build constraints support via ``--use-feature=build-constraint``.
This allows constraining the versions of packages used during the build process
(e.g., setuptools). Build constraints can be specified via ``PIP_BUILD_CONSTRAINT``
environment variable or ``--build-constraint`` flag.
