Add support for build constraints via the ``--build-constraint`` option. This
allows constraining the versions of packages used during the build process
(e.g., setuptools).

When using ``--build-constraint``, you can no longer pass constraints to
isolated build environments via the ``PIP_CONSTRAINT`` environment variable.
To opt in to this behavior without specifying any build constraints, use
``--use-feature=build-constraint``.
